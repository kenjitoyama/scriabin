# Scriabin

Scriabin is a system for mapping [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) and ([UTF8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)) text. The mappings are designed to be open, extensible and simple to write.

For example, a MIDI instrument (e.g.: a [MIDI keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_keyboard)) can be used as an input device. Musical instruments are extremely expressive and have been evolving for centuries. They have physical controls like velocity, sustain pedal, aftertouch and pitch bend that can provide interesting interactions with a computer. For example, in layout00.asciipb velocity is used to switch between lowercase and uppercase letters, and the sustain pedal is used to completely change the layout from letters to symbols.

Here's a small video showing Scriabin being used as an input device: https://youtu.be/7X2EE1txSv8.

Generation of text from music and generation of music from text are two tasks easily accomplished with Scriabin. Because the mappings are completely user-defined, these transformations can sound wildly differently depending on the specific Scriabin layout used.
